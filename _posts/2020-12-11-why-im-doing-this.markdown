It's a funny thing: about a year ago, I already convinced myself that I was going to make moves toward a tech career. I began by brushing up on some of my linux fundamentals, python, and learning a little bit of c. Soon, I was carrying my inexpensive refurbished laptop around with me so I could keep working on the material between shifts at the French Quarter restaurant where I was working. Soon thereafter, I was, well, no longer working in a restaurant (nor were most of my friends and colleagues).

Turns out, my instincts were right, but world-historical events conspired to put a fire under me and get me to commit to the path of learning at perhaps a slightly different pace than I had previously intended. As awful and painful as this year has been for everyone, I am grateful that I am finally going to lean all the way in to software development. A lot of the self-directed learning on the topic (with some help from a few friends) is already paying off as I start this course, and I look forward to getting my life back under control as everything else around us feels like it's spiralling.
